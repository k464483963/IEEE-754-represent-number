Description
-----------
	This project can get the hexadecimal given by the user, then convert
the hexadecimal to IEEE-754 floating point number and display the the sign
bit part, exponent part, and mantissa part. 

How to compile
-----------
    To compile this project, simply log in ucsd account in the terminal. 
enter the pa3 directory which include the Makefile and type "make filename"

How to run
-----------
  To run fpdec project, if enter less or greater than two argument then display
the INVALID_ARGS and SHORT_USAGE message. if the user enter two argument, then 
need to follow the format, type the"./executableName HexadecimalNumber". for 
example, ./fpdec 0x41260000. Or the user can run the unit test files. like 
simple tyoe"./testfileName", for example, "./testparseNum"

Normal output
-----------
    The normal output would  print the IEEE-754 floating number representation
 by sign, exponent, and mantissa.  An example of normal output would be the 
following: 
cs30s120cg@pi-cluster-037:~/pa3$ ./fpdec 0x41260000
Sign Bit: 0
Unbiased Exponent: 3
Mantissa: a60000

Abnormal output
-----------
    Abnormal output is printed to stderr. If the user enter more than or less 
than two argument. then the error messege would display. the example would be
 the follow:
cs30s120cg@pi-cluster-037:~/pa3$ ./fpdec           
Incorrect number of arguments.

Usage ./fpdec {hexString}

cs30s120cg@pi-cluster-037:~/pa3$ ./fpdec 0x41260000 0x233
Incorrect number of arguments.

Usage ./fpdec {hexString}


Testing
-----------
If the user enter more than or less 
than two argument. then the error messege would display:

cs30s120cg@pi-cluster-037:~/pa3$ ./fpdec           
Incorrect number of arguments.

Usage ./fpdec {hexString}

cs30s120cg@pi-cluster-037:~/pa3$ ./fpdec 0x41260000 0x233
Incorrect number of arguments.

Usage ./fpdec {hexString}
